# ASTRO-JUMPER
A game where you shall press particular numbers to jump on the particular numbered obstacles.

||NOTE: STILL IN DEVELOPMENT, THERE MIGHT EXIST SOME CHANGES TO THE ALREADY PRE EXISTING FILES AS WELL AND AS THE PROJECT UNFOLDS THERE MIGHT EXIST NEW DEPENDECY TOOLS AS WELL FOR THE BETTER WORKING OF THE PROJECT.||

Aim/Objective of this project: To develop a game, which is a two dimensional endless runner where upon press of the particular number, the playable character shall jump acrooss the particular numbered obstacle.

Tools/Necessary Libraries: WxWidgets - A C++ GUI library (needs proper setup and implementation right now).

Workflow for this project:

Phase - 1 (Currently working on this phase):
To develop a menu screen which shows name of the game, and to select between two things which were being 'start game, difficulty(Easy, Medium, Hard, Sinister), score and close the game' should have a proper edge cases and error handling to it as well incase of wrong selection or improper selections.
1. Should be able to have a proper test case or error handling for the selection of options.
2. If the user input is 'int' based then it shall focus in taking only the 'int' based user input only.

Phase - 2:
shall center around the creation of numbered objects and need to generate those objects in the game upon the difficulty selection but by default the difficulty is set to easy. So, we shall first start off from generating the numbers in the easy difficulty from 1 to 10 numbers.

Phase - 3:
Numbers will be generated as per the task 2, but in this task the numbers need to slowly speed up the generation by which game gets complicated as well.

PROTOTYPE - 1 VERSION WORKFLOW:
difficulty will have only one mode which is easy mode and we perfect it out first and we perfect it out with number generations and numbers which will automatically sped up, all these things will be checked.

PROTOTYPE - 2 VERSION (could be final version)WORKFLOW:
upon perfecting out easy difficulty with all the functionalities we will move into the further more difficulties as well with same functional applications of the prototype version - 1

Phase - 4:
Will work on the medium difficulty numbers generation and if possible we will also include the functionality within the game where the generation gets slowly sped up to increase the complexity of the game slowly. similar workflow for the hard and very hard/sinister difficulties

Phase - 5:
Documentation or code logic task.
